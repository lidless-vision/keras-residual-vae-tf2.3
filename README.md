# keras-residual-vae-tf2.3

a simple keras implimentation of a deep variational autoencoder 
using residual blocks in the encoder and decoder. 

this is very much a work in progress...

the pretrained models are on my other computer so ill post those tomorrow.


tested with:
--tensorflow 2.2.0

** okay so tensorflow 2.3.0 seems to have a bug that is also present in tf-nightly as of yesterday (7-29-2020)  **
**       where there is a memory leak and its not very useful.  **
    
--ubuntu 18.04 
--cuda 10.1 

using the celeb-ms-cropped-aligned set from a torrent somewhere on academic torrents? 
i will post those instructions soon
