# keras-residual-vae-tf2.3

a simple keras implimentation of a deep variational autoencoder 
using residual blocks in the encoder and decoder. 

Tensorflow 2.3.0 seems to have hardcore memory leak somewhere

i have written some code to attempt a workaround for it, 
but i didnt realize how aggresively bad the memory leak is.
