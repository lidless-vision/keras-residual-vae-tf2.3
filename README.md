# keras-residual-vae-tf2.3

a simple keras implimentation of a deep variational autoencoder 
using residual blocks in the encoder and decoder. 

this is very much a work in progress...

the pretrained models are on my other computer so ill post those tomorrow.


tested with:
    tensorflow 2.3.0 (or tensorflow 2.2.0)
    ubuntu 18.04 
    cuda 10.1 

using the celeb-ms-cropped-aligned set from a torrent somewhere on academic torrents? 
i will post those instructions soon
