# keras-residual-vae-tf2.3


this is very much a work in progress...

a simple keras implimentation of a deep variational autoencoder using residual blocks in the encoder and decoder. 
tested in:

tensorflow 2.3.0 (or tensorflow 2.2.0)
ubuntu 18.04 
cuda 10.1 

using the celeb-ms-cropped-aligned set from a torrent somewhere on academic torrents? 
i will post those instructions soon but maybe just... google it?
